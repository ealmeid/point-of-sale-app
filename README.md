# point-of-sale-app
**point-of-sale-app** is a simple application made without any front end frameworks (for now), using MongoDB, NodeJS, and ExpressJS. The application currently allows you to select a limited selection of drinks, add them to a cart, see the subtotal as well as the items that make it up, and checkout.

## Things to add
- [ ] Allow drinks to have different sizes (Small, Med, Large)
- [ ] Replace customization input fields with an increment/decrement or numberpad
- [ ] Add 'amount tendered' and payment options in checkout
- [ ] Properly handle order object once it's checked out
- [ ] Fix initial loading page speed
